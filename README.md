Sentiment analysis of Amazon Echo product reviews is the main objective of the project. Preprocessing involves converting review data to lower case, eliminating special characters, and removing stop words. Find the frequency of each word, visualise the most often used word using a wordcloud, and use ngrams to display patterns and discover the next word.
